A Trinary Tree implementation and StringToLong.

The trinary tree is really just a binary tree that does not merge equality with the less than or greater than side of tree.

StringToLong with no internal libraries is really just about managing errors that can result with fixed length data types (under/over flow) and
any weirdness in the input
